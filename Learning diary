Notes on Node.js segment:

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime written in C++.
Do I need to know C++ to be an expert in Node.js? 

It runs on your machine as a service or a runtime, not in the browser. 

Runtime vs. framework

Allows JavaScript able to run on the server.

Node.js suggested precursors:

HTTP (status codes, headers, etc.) 
JSON (for when Node is used for REST APIs and microservices)
Arrow Functions, Promises -> ES6+ (ECMAScript is a standard that web browsers follow while interpreting Javascript.)
Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern

WHY USE NODE?

Fast, efficient and highly scalable
Event driven, runs on a single loop, has a non-blocking I/O model
Popular with startups 
Same language on both ends when used with JavaScript frameworks like React Vue Angular

Non-blocking I/O
Asynchronous non-blocking on a single thread capable of holding 10s of thousands of connections hedl in the event loop
optomizing throughput and scalabilty
Not goood for CPU intensive apps

Event or process triggers an event or process
Firing a callback
Events run in the loop 
triggers
